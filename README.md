# CS4248 Group 46 Project (LUN)

## Contributing to the Project

To maintain the quality and manageability of the project, we request all members to follow our branching model for any changes, improvements, or bug fixes.

## Getting Started

Before making any changes, ensure you have the latest version of the project and are working in a dedicated branch for your contribution.

## Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/CS4248-Team46/CS4248_Group_46_project.git
```

Change into the repository's directory:

```
cd CS4248_Group_46
```

Make sure your local repository is up to date with the origin:

```
git pull origin main
```

## Creating a New Branch

All changes should be made in a separate branch. This keeps the main branch stable and allows for easy review and integration of new features or fixes.

### Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your changes. Name your branch in a way that reflects the changes or feature you're working on:

```
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

For example, if you're testing a specific model, you might name your branch `model-analysis`.

## Make Your Changes

With your branch checked out, open the Jupyter Notebook or other project files and make your changes. Please ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and conventions.

### Commit and Push Your Changes

After making your changes, commit them to your branch:

```
git add .
git commit -m "A descriptive message about your changes"
```

Then, push your branch to the repository:

```
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```
